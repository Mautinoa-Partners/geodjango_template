GeoPandas is a project to add support for geographic data to
`pandas`_ objects.

The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in
python easier. It combines the capabilities of `pandas`_ and `shapely`_,
providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface
to multiple geometries to shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do
operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database
such as PostGIS.
