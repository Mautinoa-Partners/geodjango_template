  "readme": "RBush\n=====\n\nRBush is a high-performance JavaScript library for 2D **spatial indexing** of points and rectangles\nby [Vladimir Agafonkin](http://github.com/mourner),\nbased on an optimized **R-tree** data structure with **bulk insertion** support.\n\n*Spatial index* is a special data structure for points and rectangles\nthat allows you to perform queries like \"all items within this bounding box\" very efficiently\n(e.g. hundreds of times faster than looping over all items).\nIt's most commonly used in maps and data visualizations.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mourner/rbush.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mourner/rbush)\n\n## Demos\n\nThe demos contain visualization of trees generated from 50k bulk-loaded random points.\nOpen web console to see benchmarks;\nclick on buttons to insert or remove items;\nclick to perform search under the cursor.\n\n* [uniformly distributed random data](http://mourner.github.io/rbush/viz/viz-uniform.html)\n* [randomly clustered data](http://mourner.github.io/rbush/viz/viz-cluster.html)\n\n## Performance\n\nThe following sample performance test was done by generating\nrandom uniformly distributed rectangles of ~0.01% area and setting `maxEntries` to `16`\n(see `debug/perf.js` script).\nPerformed with Node.js v5.2.0 on a Retina Macbook Pro 15 (mid-2012).\n\nTest                         | RBush  | [old RTree](https://github.com/imbcmdth/RTree) | Improvement\n---------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----\ninsert 1M items one by one   | 4.7s   | 9.26s  | 2x\n1000 searches of 0.01% area  | 0.06s  | 1.12s  | 20x\n1000 searches of 1% area     | 0.43s  | 2.73s  | 6.3x\n1000 searches of 10% area    | 2.19s  | 11.56s | 5.3x\nremove 1000 items one by one | 0.02s  | 1.44s  | 65x\nbulk-insert 1M items         | 1.38s  | n/a    | 6.7x\n\n## Usage\n\n### Creating a Tree\n\n```js\nvar tree = rbush(9);\n```\n\nAn optional argument to `rbush` defines the maximum number of entries in a tree node.\nIt drastically affects the performance, so you should adjust it\nconsidering the type of data and search queries you perform.\n\n### Adding and Removing Data\n\nInsert an item:\n\n```js\nvar item = [20, 40, 30, 50]; // [x1, y1, x2, y2]\ntree.insert(item);\n```\n\nRemove a previously inserted item:\n\n```js\ntree.remove(item);\n```\n\nClear all items:\n\n```js\ntree.clear();\n```\n\nItems inserted in the tree can have other arbitrary properties/elements that you can access later:\n\n```js\nvar item1 = [20, 40, 30, 50, {foo: 'bar'}];\ntree.insert(item1);\n\nvar item2 = [15, 15, 30, 30];\nitem2.foo = 'bar';\ntree.insert(item2);\n```\n\n### Data Format\n\nBy default, RBush assumes the format of data points to be `[minX, minY, maxX, maxY]`\n(bounding box coordinates, or just `[x, y, x, y]` for points).\nYou can customize this by providing an array with `minX`, `minY`, `maxX`, `maxY` accessor strings\nas a second argument to `rbush` like this:\n\n```js\nvar tree = rbush(9, ['.minLng', '.minLat', '.maxLng', '.maxLat']);\ntree.insert({id: 'foo', minLng: 30, minLat: 50, maxLng: 40, maxLat: 60});\n```\n\n### Bulk-Inserting Data\n\nBulk-insert the given data into the tree:\n\n```js\ntree.load([\n\t[10, 10, 15, 20],\n\t[12, 15, 40, 64.5],\n\t...\n]);\n```\n\nBulk insertion is usually ~2-3 times faster than inserting items one by one.\nAfter bulk loading (bulk insertion into an empty tree), subsequent query performance is also ~20-30% better.\n\nWhen you do bulk insertion into an existing tree, it bulk-loads the given data into a separate tree\nand inserts the smaller tree into the larger tree.\nThis means that bulk insertion works very well for clustered data (where items are close to each other),\nbut makes query performance worse if the data is scattered.\n\n### Search\n\n```js\nvar result = tree.search([40, 20, 80, 70]);\n```\n\nReturns an array of data items (points or rectangles) that the given bounding box (`[minX, minY, maxX, maxY]`) intersects.\n\n```js\nvar allItems = tree.all();\n```\n\nReturns all items of the tree.\n\n### Collisions\n\n```js\nvar result = tree.collides([40, 20, 80, 70]);\n```\n\nReturns `true` if there are any items intersecting the given bounding box, otherwise `false`.\n\n\n### Export and Import\n\n```js\n// export data as JSON object\nvar treeData = tree.toJSON();\n\n// import previously exported data\nvar tree = rbush(9).fromJSON(treeData);\n```\n\nImporting and exporting as JSON allows you to use RBush on both the server (using Node.js) and the browser combined,\ne.g. first indexing the data on the server and and then importing the resulting tree data on the client for searching.\n\n### K-Nearest Neighbors\n\nFor \"_k_ nearest neighbors around a point\" type of queries for RBush,\ncheck out [rbush-knn](https://github.com/mourner/rbush-knn).\n\n## Algorithms Used\n\n* single insertion: non-recursive R-tree insertion with overlap minimizing split routine from R\\*-tree (split is very effective in JS, while other R\\*-tree modifications like reinsertion on overflow and overlap minimizing subtree search are too slow and not worth it)\n* single deletion: non-recursive R-tree deletion using depth-first tree traversal with free-at-empty strategy (entries in underflowed nodes are not reinserted, instead underflowed nodes are kept in the tree and deleted only when empty, which is a good compromise of query vs removal performance)\n* bulk loading: OMT algorithm (Overlap Minimizing Top-down Bulk Loading) combined with Floyd–Rivest selection algorithm\n* bulk insertion: STLT algorithm (Small-Tree-Large-Tree)\n* search: standard non-recursive R-tree search\n\n## Papers\n\n* [R-trees: a Dynamic Index Structure For Spatial Searching](http://www-db.deis.unibo.it/courses/SI-LS/papers/Gut84.pdf)\n* [The R*-tree: An Efficient and Robust Access Method for Points and Rectangles+](http://dbs.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/publications/myPapers/1990/BKSS90.pdf)\n* [OMT: Overlap Minimizing Top-down Bulk Loading Algorithm for R-tree](http://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-74/files/FORUM_18.pdf)\n* [Bulk Insertions into R-Trees Using the Small-Tree-Large-Tree Approach](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~bkmoon/papers/dke06-bulk.pdf)\n* [R-Trees: Theory and Applications (book)](http://www.apress.com/9781852339777)\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\nnpm install  # install dependencies\n\nnpm test     # check the code with JSHint and run tests\nnpm run perf # run performance benchmarks\nnpm run cov  # report test coverage (with more detailed report in coverage/lcov-report/index.html)\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nRBush should run on Node and all major browsers. The only caveat: IE 8 needs an [Array#indexOf polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf#Polyfill) for `remove` method to work.\n\n## Changelog\n\n#### 1.4.2 &mdash; Dec 16, 2015\n\n- 50% faster insertion.\n\n#### 1.4.1 &mdash; Sep 16, 2015\n\n- Fixed insertion in IE8.\n\n#### 1.4.0 &mdash; Apr 22, 2015\n\n- Added `collides` method for fast collision detection.\n\n#### 1.3.4 &mdash; Aug 31, 2014\n\n- Improved bulk insertion performance for a large number of items (e.g. up to 100% for inserting a million items).\n- Fixed performance regression for high node sizes.\n\n#### 1.3.3 &mdash; Aug 30, 2014\n\n- Improved bulk insertion performance by ~60-70%.\n- Improved insertion performance by ~40%.\n- Improved search performance by ~30%.\n\n#### 1.3.2 &mdash; Nov 25, 2013\n\n- Improved removal performance by ~50%.
